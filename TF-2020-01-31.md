# Tidy Friday workshop series
This series will use data from the `#TidyTuesday` project.
To learn more about this project check out the [R for Data Science GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience) page.
You can find a few code samples there as well, but to see even more examples, follow `#TidyTuesday` on Twitter.  

This week I've chosen a couple of examples that illustrate the powerful mapping capabilities of R.

## Example 1
### Global UFO Sightings
